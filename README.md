# Live analysis of Bitcoin price from Bitfinex, OKEx, Binance and Poloniex

***

## Description:
This is a study project where I used **asynchronous programmation** to download data and analyse it in the same time, and I used **cython** to speed-up the analysis. I also used my own econometric tools, they are surely not the best ones, but I kept control over them.
